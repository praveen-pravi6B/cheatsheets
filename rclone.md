### Basic Configuration

```bash
rclone config       # Start the interactive configuration wizard to add new remotes. 
rclone config show  # Display the current configuration. 
rclone listremotes  # List the names of all configured remotes. 
```

### Listing Files & Directories

```bash
rclone ls <remote>:<path>    # List files and file sizes.
rclone lsl <remote>:<path>   # List files, sizes, and modification times.
rclone ls d <remote>:<path>  # List directories only.
rclone tree <remote>:<path>  # List contents in a tree-like structure.
```

### Copying & Syncing

#### Copy

```bash
rclone copy <source> <dest>            # Copy new/changed files. 
rclone copy <source> <dest> --dry-run  # Test the copy operation without making changes. 
```

#### Sync

```bash
rclone sync <source> <dest>            # Sync source to destination.
rclone sync <source> <dest> --dry-run  # Test the sync operation (recommended before actual sync). 
```

### Deleting & Moving

```bash
rclone move <source> <dest>    # Move files (copy and then delete the source).
rclone delete <remote>:<path>  # Delete the files in the path.
rclone purge <remote>:<path>   # Delete the path and all of its contents. (Irrecoverable!) 
rclone rmdir <remote>:<path>   # Remove an empty directory.
```

### File Manipulation

```bash
rclone mkdir <remote>:<path>           # Create a new directory.
rclone touch <remote>:<path>/file.txt  # Create a new file with the current time. 
rclone cat <remote>:<path>/file.txt    # Output the file content to standard output. 
rclone check <source> <dest>           # Check if the files in source and dest are identical.
```

### Important Flags (General)

```bash
--dry-run                     # Show what would be transferred without doing it. 
-P or --progress              # Show progress during transfer. 
--transfers=N                 # Set number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4). 
--checkers=N                  # Set number of checkers to run in parallel (default 8). 
--max-age <time>              # Don't transfer files older than <time>. 
--min-age <time>              # Don't transfer files newer than <time>. 
--include <filter>            # Include files matching this pattern. 
--exclude <filter>            # Exclude files matching this pattern. 
--fast-list                   # Use recursive listing to speed up checks (may use more memory). 
--multi-thread-cutoff <size>  # Use multiple threads for files bigger than <size>. 
--multi-thread-streams <N>    # Number of streams to use for multi-thread transfers.
